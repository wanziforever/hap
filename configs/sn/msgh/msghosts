# This file contains the names and IDs of the hosts

# that MSGH will try to communicate with.  This file must

# be the same on all machines in a MSGH network.

#

# In this file, comments can be made with a "#" in column 1.

#

# Non commentary lines have 3 white-space separated fields:

# field 1 contains a number from 0 through 63, and is the

#       host number.

# field 2 contains the logical name of the processor that can be

#       used for sending to processes using the "hostname:queuename"

#       syntax.

# fields 3 and 4 contain the names of the two addresses that can

#       be used to reach that host. Those entries must exist in /etc/hosts

#       file.  A preferred path can be specified by placing an * in front

#       of the name.  If simplex networking is used, the same name can

#       be used twice.

# field 5 contains the real name of the machine.  One of these

#       should be the uname of the current machine (minus the -0 or -1

#       in duplex machines) and the rest must have entries the the

#       hosts file.

#

# If there are no entries in this list, MSGH assumes that networking

# mode is turned off.
